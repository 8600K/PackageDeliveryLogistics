# pythonProject
Logistics project that incorperates two trucks, a certain amount of packages, a certain amount of fuel, and distance between every address.
This project utilizes an algorithm I made to traverse addresses in Salt Lake City in an efficent manner. There are a few constraints the program is also working with.
For instance, the two trucks can only deliver a set amount of packages at a time, and they only have a certain amount of fuel before they need to go back to headquarters to
refill and pick up the ramaining packages. 
There are also a few other things going on within this program, for instance timers to keep track of the trucks and their positions, and one of the main things I did
when I was creating this project was focus on modularity, for example I wanted this project to be able to work with any set packages and addresses. The algorithm is not
specified to only work with this imported set of addresses and packages. Speaking of imports, I should mention there is a file I/O for the actual  packages and addresses, but
that's a pretty minor part compared to the algorithm itself.
